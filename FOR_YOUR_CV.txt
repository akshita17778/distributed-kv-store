INTERVIEW TIPS:
================================================================================

If asked "Tell me about this project":
"I built a distributed key-value store that demonstrates my understanding 
of distributed systems. It uses consistent hashing for load balancing, 
automatic replication for fault tolerance, and a coordinator-node architecture 
for scalability. The system can handle node failures and rebalances keys 
automatically."

If asked "What was the hardest part?":
"Implementing the consistent hashing algorithm correctly, especially handling 
virtual nodes for load balancing and ensuring the replication strategy worked 
across multiple nodes."

If asked "What would you improve?":
"I'd add persistence (SQLite/RocksDB), a gossip protocol for better failure 
detection, TTL support for keys, and REST API wrapper for easier integration."

================================================================================
QUICK COMMANDS FOR INTERVIEW DEMO:
================================================================================

Start the system (run these in 4 separate terminal windows):

Terminal 1 - Coordinator:
  cd C:\Users\vikas\distributed-kv-store\coordinator
  python coordinator.py

Terminal 2 - Node 1:
  cd C:\Users\vikas\distributed-kv-store\node
  python node.py --port 5001

Terminal 3 - Node 2:
  cd C:\Users\vikas\distributed-kv-store\node
  python node.py --port 5002

Terminal 4 - Test:
  cd C:\Users\vikas\distributed-kv-store\client
  python client.py --command "LIST_NODES"
  python client.py --command "PUT test-key test-value"
  python client.py --command "GET test-key"

OR Quick demo (single command):
  cd C:\Users\vikas\distributed-kv-store
  python cv_demo.py
