OPTION 2: DETAILED (For Real Cover Letters / Detailed CV)
================================================================================

Distributed Key-Value Store with Consistent Hashing
Technical Lead | Python | Architecture & Implementation

• Architected and implemented a production-grade distributed key-value store system
  - Coordinator-Node-Client architecture with TCP socket communication
  - Consistent hashing algorithm for O(1) data lookups across cluster
  - Automatic data replication (1 primary + 2 replicas per key)
  - Node discovery, registration, and heartbeat-based failure detection
  - Multi-threaded servers handling concurrent client connections

• Key Achievements:
  - Fault tolerant: system operates with minimum 1 node, fully redundant with 3 nodes
  - Scalable design: supports dynamic node addition/removal with automatic rebalancing
  - Zero downtime: automatic failover to replica nodes on primary failure
  - Well documented: 600+ lines of documentation, comprehensive test suite

• Technologies: Python 3, TCP/IP Networking, Multithreading, Data Structures (Hash Ring)
